# Repository Shape

## Goal

Define the repository states before bootstrap, during bootstrap, and after cleanup.

## Why Shape Matters

Repository shape is a communication channel. Future agents infer what matters from where files live, which files remain, and which files are packaged.

The template uses structure to make authority visible: `.intake/` is user evidence, `.template/` is temporary bootstrap guidance, `skills/<name>/` is the runtime skill, `tests/` is maintenance evidence, and `docs/` is durable repository explanation.

## Shape Values

- Make the current repository mode obvious from the file tree.
- Keep temporary construction files separate from durable product files.
- Keep runtime packages smaller than the repository.
- Make release artifact structure match install expectations.

## Bootstrap Mode

The repository starts in bootstrap mode after a user creates it from the template.

```text
skill-repository/
|-- AGENTS.md
|-- README.md
|-- .intake/
|-- .template/
|-- .plans/
|-- skills/
|-- tests/
|-- docs/
|-- packaging/
|-- scripts/
`-- .github/
```

In bootstrap mode, `.template/` is present and `AGENTS.md` points agents to `.template/bootstrap/`. The template also ships `.plans/`, its own maintenance backlog, which is removed during cleanup.

Rationale: Bootstrap instructions need to be discoverable during construction, but visibly temporary so agents know they must not package or preserve them.

## Generated Skill Product

The agent builds the skill product while `.template/` still exists.

```text
skills/
`-- skill-name/
    |-- SKILL.md
    |-- references/
    |-- scripts/
    `-- assets/

tests/
`-- fixtures/
```

Only create optional folders when they contain useful files or clarify a generated package shape.

Rationale: Empty or unnecessary folders imply capabilities the skill may not actually have. The repository should communicate the real skill surface.

## Maintenance Mode

After cleanup, the repository must stand alone as a skill repository.

```text
skill-name/
|-- AGENTS.md
|-- README.md
|-- CHANGELOG.md
|-- LICENSE
|-- .intake/
|-- .skill-template-feedback/
|-- INSTALL.md
|-- skills/
|-- tests/
|-- docs/
|-- packaging/
|-- scripts/
`-- .github/
```

Maintenance-mode `AGENTS.md` must no longer describe bootstrap. It must describe how future agents maintain the generated skill.

`.skill-template-feedback/` is the local channel for routing template gaps back upstream. Only its `README.md` and `.gitkeep` are tracked; everything else stays local.

Rationale: The closest instruction file becomes the future agent's operating frame. If it still describes bootstrap, future maintenance can drift toward rebuilding instead of preserving.

## Release Artifact Shape

Release artifacts are smaller than the repository because users install skills, not project history.
