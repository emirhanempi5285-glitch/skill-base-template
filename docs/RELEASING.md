# Releasing and repository workflow

This document is the single source for how changes land in a generated skill repository and how a release is cut. It is written for a human or an agent maintaining the repository, and it explains both the steps and the GitHub features that enforce them.

Template repository releases use a separate process. See `docs/TEMPLATE-RELEASING.md`.

Generated skill release workflows live under `.template/generated/.github/workflows/` until the bootstrap agent installs them during cleanup. After cleanup they live at `.github/workflows/`.

## How changes land

The `main` branch is protected, so no change reaches it by a direct push, including from an administrator. Every change goes through a pull request that passes checks and is then squash-merged.

The flow for any change:

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Make the change and run `npm run validate` locally.
3. Push the branch and open a pull request into `main`.
4. Wait for the required `Validate skill package` check to pass.
5. Resolve any review conversations.
6. Squash-merge the pull request.

Dependabot changes follow the same path. It opens pull requests for GitHub Actions and dependency updates, which must pass the check and be squash-merged.

## What protects `main`

A repository ruleset on the default branch enforces these rules. The hardening commands that create it are in `.template/bootstrap/cleanup-and-boundaries.md`.

- A pull request is required before merging, with conversation resolution required and stale approvals dismissed on push.
- The `Validate skill package` status check must pass, and the branch must be up to date with `main` first.
- Force pushes and branch deletion are blocked.
- Linear history is required, and the only allowed merge method is squash.
- The rules are enforced for administrators too.

Required approvals are set to zero so a solo maintainer is not blocked. Raise this to one and require `CODEOWNERS` review if a second maintainer becomes active.

## Other repository safeguards

Secret scanning and push protection are enabled, so a credential pushed by mistake is caught before it reaches the public repository. Dependabot alerts and security updates are enabled, alongside the version updates configured in `.github/dependabot.yml`.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pull requests and on pushes to `main`. Its job, `Validate skill package`, runs `npm run validate` and a packaging smoke test. This job is the required status check, so a pull request cannot merge unless validation and packaging succeed.

## Cutting a release

A release is a version bump landed through a pull request, followed by a tag.

1. On a branch, update `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and the relevant runtime references, then update root `INSTALL.md`, `README.md`, maintenance fixtures, and the affected files in `docs/`.
2. Set the new version in `package.json` and in both `packaging/*/plugin.json`.
3. Add a `## [vX.Y.Z]` section to `CHANGELOG.md`, move any entries from `## [Unreleased]` into it, and reset `## [Unreleased]` to note no unreleased changes. The release workflow requires this exact heading for the tag.
4. Add `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` with the release notes. The release workflow requires this file for the tag.
5. Run `gh skill publish --dry-run` from a clean checkout before generated files exist, then run `npm run validate` and `npm run package -- vX.Y.Z`. Assets are written to ignored `dist/assets/`.
6. Open the pull request, let the check pass, and squash-merge it into `main`.

## Tagging and the draft release

After the version bump is on `main`, push a `vX.Y.Z` tag. Pushing a tag is not a push to the `main` branch, so the branch ruleset does not block it. The tag triggers `.github/workflows/release-draft.yml`, which validates the skill, packages the assets, creates or updates a draft GitHub release from `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`, and uploads the ZIP assets. It refuses to run if the matching `## [vX.Y.Z]` section in `CHANGELOG.md` or the release-notes file is missing.

An active tag ruleset should prevent updates and deletion for public `v*` release tags. Correct a release with a new version because moving a published tag breaks installed source identity and artifact provenance.

The workflow leaves the release as a draft with three ZIPs, `SHA256SUMS`, and provenance attestations. Review it on GitHub and publish it manually.

Do not use `gh skill publish --tag` for a generated repository with this release workflow. That preview command can push the branch and create an immediately published release without the generated packages, checksums, attestations, curated notes, or draft review.

Publishing the draft triggers `.github/workflows/gh-skill-install.yml`, which installs the versionless public release in an ephemeral runner and verifies its source metadata and runtime content without executing the skill.

## Versioning

Use tags in `vX.Y.Z` format as the release source of truth. The version in `package.json`, both plugin manifests, the `CHANGELOG.md` heading, and the `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` file must all match the tag.
