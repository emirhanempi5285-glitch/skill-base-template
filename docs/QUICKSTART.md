# Quickstart

This repository starts as a template for building a skill repository.

## Create A Skill Repository

1. Open the template repository on GitHub.
2. Click `Use this template`.
3. Select `Create a new repository`.
4. Choose the owner, repository name, description, and visibility.
5. Click `Create repository from template`.
6. Clone the generated repository.
7. Add source material or a short skill idea to `.intake/`.
8. Ask an AI coding agent to build the skill from intake.
9. Let the agent assess and resolve intake gaps before skill construction.
10. Let the agent rewrite the repository into maintenance mode.
11. Review the generated skill, docs, manifests, and validation results.

## What To Expect From The Agent

The agent should not merely fill placeholders. It should infer the reusable capability hidden in the intake, decide what belongs in the skill, record important assumptions, and explain the reasoning that future maintainers need.

If the agent finds contradictions in the intake, it should resolve low-risk issues locally and document high-impact assumptions. The goal is a maintainable skill, not a perfect transcript of every source file.

If `.intake/` is empty, weak, conflicting, or exploratory, the agent should not replace the placeholder skill immediately. It should first determine what is missing, why the missing evidence matters, and how to resolve the gap with minimal human help.

Expected resolution paths include extracting evidence, making low-risk assumptions, inspecting local tools or docs, creating disposable experiments, narrowing scope, asking concise questions, or stopping before construction when the skill would otherwise be fabricated.

## What The Agent Builds

The agent renames `skills/placeholder-skill/` to the confirmed final name and builds its `SKILL.md`, runtime references, root installation guide, GitHub CLI orientation, separate maintenance fixtures, packaging manifests, release notes, and maintenance mode `AGENTS.md`.

## After Cleanup

After cleanup, `.template/` should be gone. The repository should read like a normal skill repository, not a generated project.

The generated `AGENTS.md` should explain how to maintain the skill and why important boundaries exist. Future agents should not need to know this template existed.
